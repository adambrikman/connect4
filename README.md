<h1>Connect 4 and Poetry</h1>
<!-- /TITLE -->

<!-- DESCRIPTION/ -->
React app built to simulate a Connect 4 game - however, the rules are that the game is over when the board is full.

Chip colors alternate between red & blue. During each move, the app pulls JSON data from http://poetrydb.org/author/Shakespeare.

A user may undeo each move, up until the beginning of the game where there are zero chips on the game board/tray.

Once the board is full, the player(s) may choose press the 'Play Again' button, resulting in a reset of the board.
